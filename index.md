Hi, I've been trying to work on lab 7 for a couple hours now, and I'm not sure how to get rid of the bug. I think the bug might be in the merge method of ListExamples.java, specifcally where it counts, but I'm not sure how to fix it. I attached screenshots of the symptom, ListExamples.java and ListExamplesTests.java below.
